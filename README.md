## Description

A C++ clone of the original game Breakout with some additional features. Includes several original sound effects.

## Execution

Everything needed for execution of the game is in BreakoutFinal.zip. Space pong utilizes SFML and some custom textures, so the executable will not run without the additional files in its current state.
